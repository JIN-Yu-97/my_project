"""
With this package, you can easily
1. do simulation and build a Monte Carlo Tree -> define an MCtreeSearch object, and call simulate()
2. save the tree -> call save_tree()
3. load the pre-built tree -> call load_tree()
4. continue to do simulation and develop the previous tree -> call simulation()
5. give solutions based on the simulation -> call find_solution() and print_solution()

What you need to do:
1. define a react function
2. define a reward function
